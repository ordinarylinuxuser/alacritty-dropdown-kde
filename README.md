# Alacritty Dropdown
Win script that adds drop-down feature to Alacritty.

It provides:
- Display/hide Alacritty when `Meta+F12` is pressed.
- Make Alacritty window _always on top_ of other windows.
- Make Alacritty visible in all desktops.
- Make Alacritty fullscreen.

What it doesn't provide:
- Start Alacritty.
- Move Alacritty to multiple displays (it is always displayed in display that it was started from).

*Works only on KDE.*

## Requirements

From version 0.3 (tag v0.3.0) only KDE 6 is supported. For KDE 5, use version 0.2.2 (tag v0.2.2).

Current requirements:
- KDE Plasma >= 6.1
- KDE Frameworks >= 6.5
- Qt >= 6.7
- Alacritty >= 0.13

Requirements are based on the version which I am running, so it might work on earlier versions of the afore mentioned components.

## Installing

- Clone somewhere and `cd` into:i
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vgobbo/alacritty-dropdown-kde.git
cd alacritty-dropdown-kde
```

- Inspect the code, so nothing weird is being added to your computer ;D

- Install:
```bash
kpackagetool6 --type=KWin/Script -i .
```

If you are upgrading, use:
```bash
kpackagetool6 --type=KWin/Script -u .
```

If you just upgraded to KDE 6 from KDE 5, you might have to manually remove the old plugin and then install it fresh.

- Enable by pressing `Alt+F2`, typing _KWin Scripts_ and selecting _Alacritty Drop-Down_ in the script list.

## Debugging

The preferred way is through `wm console`, according to KDE documentation. But it didn't work for me, so I relied on `journalctl` for debugging:
```bash
journalctl -f -t kwin_x11
```

Adapt it to Wayland if needed.

## Common Issues

### Nothing happens when Meta+F12 is pressed

- Make sure Alacritty is installed and running.
- Make sure the script is installed and enabled.
- Make sure the _compose key_ is not set to `Meta` on the _System Settings > Input Devices > Keyboard > Advanced > Position of compose key_.

### Window is borderless but not fullscreen
- Make sure `startup_mode` *is not set* to `Fullscreen` in `.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`: let the script take care of the window configuration.

## Tips and Tricks

- Below settings will allow to start alacritty in background when you start kde and you can press `Meta + F12` to directly show alacritty without having to worry about to start it manually.
  - Add alacritty to auto start in system settings
  - Set windows Rules
        - class exact match - alacritty Alacritty
        - size (set what ever size you want)
        - minimized - Yes (apply initially)
        - initial placement - centered
        - Ignore Requested Geometry - Yes
        - skip taskbar - Yes
        - skip pager - Yes
        - skip switcher - Yes
